            Originally, artificial intelligence was reserved for academics, it was a relatively new concept that used algorithms to perform tasks such as playing chess in the form of a large super computer, for example when IBM's Deep Blue beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov. This was the first time where AI was truly shown to possess abilities to beat human chess players, and the best human chess players in the world at that. Whilst a major milestone in artificial intelligence and an amazing feat, this was also arguably the first sign of human obsolescence as a result of AI. As supercomputers grew more powerful and AI grew more intelligent, this began to become normal. Continuing with the game of chess, specialised models such as Stockfish moved onto competing with other AI models, leaving humans firmly behind. With the release of Stockfish 12 in 2020, the model began to implement NNUE, an updating neural network, eventually completely replacing the outdated classical evaluation algorithms in 2023. Although, due to the nature of chess, this obsolescence remained limited, as AI remains confined to analysis of human chess games, training and competing with other AI models to improve.

            Now let's look at AI in programming. It's June 2021, and GitHub Copilot is announced by GitHub using OpenAI models, autocompleting code and generating code snippets, available for independent developers and business worldwide. While this is exciting, there is the obvious threat of programming jobs. While Copilot is a useful tool to have for many programmers, improving code efficiency by allowing the programmer to focus on solving complex logical problems and easy code taking up time, there is the obvious threat of its evolution - putting many jobs at risk. Unlike with chess, companies who focus on profit will definitely favour the more cost-effective AI when developing simple programs. Luckily, jobs with responsibilities such as maintaining large databases will be less threatened, as these tasks are very complex and companies will undoubtedly prefer to place their trust in trustworthy employees rather than experimental AI.

            In addition to chess analysis, AI can also be used in other ways to assist humans rather than encourage their obsolescence (such as replacing programmers), with another notable example being that of voice assistants. Services such as Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana and Google Assistant have been integrated into their respective devices since 2011. In the early days, the services used machine learning and basic neural networks in order to provide convenience for the user, for example: asking the assistant what the forecast will be rather than opening the weather app.
