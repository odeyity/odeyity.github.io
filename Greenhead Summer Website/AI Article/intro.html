	        Hello, I am Noah Dainty and my project is about how artificial intelligence can be applied in real-world situations and how the technology has the capabilities to assist humans in the working world and society, without completely replacing humans and leaving us obsolete - a very real threat and concern often raised in conversations regarding AI. This website serves as a hub to learn more about the development of AI over the years and its current uses, as well as future goals for its technology in various fields such as medicine and education.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reason that I picked this project is due to its relevancy in today's fields - artificial intelligence is becoming prevalent in all fields and industries, improving efficiency in menial tasks and creating new possibilities that were not available before; however with the pros come many cons such as: human obsolescence, data privacy concerns and massive energy consumption. In my project, I plan to explore how these flaws may be solved and how solutions could look in the future, whilst AI continues to grow at exponential rates and become integrated within our society more closely. I also hope to be at the forefront of AI in the future, controlling how it is developed, solving its issues and applying it into different areas such as medicine.
        </p>

        <p>
            I know that through my research for this project, I will be in a better position to understand AI in its current form and hopefully give an informative insight to others about the development of AI.
